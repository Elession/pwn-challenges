## challenges
1. 64b binary with 9 arguments (means need all 6 registers, and 3 on stack) for rop based challenge (triplerop)
2. ret2libc (libraryc)  DONE
3. ret2shellcode (shellfish) (not sure where to put this see how)
4. libc version leak
5. heap (need study first)
6. overwrite other variable
7. 


## misc that can be done
- make simple script to auto deploy challenges using Dockerfile and bash 
- script to autochange and auto redeploy challenges upon flag submission (problem is the time to redeploy, but ofc test and see how)
